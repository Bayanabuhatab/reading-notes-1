Java allows us to make web pages more interactive .
This can be in some steps:
* access content 
* modify content 
* program rules
* react of events

The basic of programming : 
* What is a script and how do I create one ?
* How do computers fit in with the world around them
* How do I write a script for a
web page?

Computers approach tasks in a different way than
humans, so your instructions must let the computer
solve the task prggrammatically.

**A script** is a series of instructions that a
computer can follow to achieve a goal. 

To write a script, we need to first
state ourr goal and then list the
tasks that need to be completed in
order to achieve it.
