## How Do Computer work
The four thing make a computer computer are: 
* Input 
* Storage 
* Processing  
* Output 

Computer started out as basic calculator.

**Input** (camera, keyboard,mic) all these are stored in memory , computer process takes information form memory and change it using serial of command  sends the processed information back to be stored in memory again.

This continue until processed information is ready to be output.

**Output** ( text, photos , signal , videos) 
computer works by ones & zeros it like one electrical wire used only one  & zero so it called *a bit*,
by using more ones & zeros we can represent more complex information , this represented called **Binary number system** .

Image contains many pixels and each pixel has a color which has a number so it can appear using binary number.
Computer contains many electronics components that organized together to make a circuit.
