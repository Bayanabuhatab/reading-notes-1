## How do I write a script for webpage ?
There are three languages that used to create webpage 
* Html 
* Css 
* JS

First we should start with html layer then we style it using css after that we make it more dynamic by JS.
To load Css file on html page we used **link** element
We may see JavaScript in the HTML between opening *<*script*>* and closing *<*/script*>* tags.

So **script** element is used in html page to tell the browser to load the JS file 
We should know that JS is case sensitive.
We start writing code in JS by using statements , each statement should be in separately lineand ends with **;**
We should write comments to explain what our code does.
