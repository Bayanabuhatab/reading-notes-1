# Process and Design 
When we create website we should care about the information it contains and organize it so the visitor can finad any thing easily. Design it to be beautiful and attracivte .

Before creating website we should made a wireframe its like a plan and how the website will look like.
Wireframes allow you to organize the information that will need to go on each page.

After that we decide what tags we want to use and start coding in VS code in Html file .

Finally it looks booring so we should use CSS and make style to our website .

## Html Versions
There is alots of html versions , each new version was designed to be an improvement on the
last .
* HTML 4
* XHTML 1.0
  * Strict XHTML 1.0
  * Transitional XHTML 1.0
  * XHTML 1.0 Framese
* XHTML 5

Because there have beennseveral versions of HTML, each web page should begin with a DOCTYPE declaration to tell a browser which version of HTML the page is using.

we can add the text between these characters:
" !-- comment goes here "
 
 **Attribute** provides additional information about the content.

The main *header* or *footer*
that appears at the top or
bottom of every page on the
site.

There is something called Site maps that allow you to plan the structure of a site.
