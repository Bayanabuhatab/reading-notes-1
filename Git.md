# Git 
**VCS** " version control system " allows you to revisit various versions of a file or set of files by recording changes, mistakes with files can easily be rectified. We can know what is the change and who do it .

**Git** gives ability to developers to work on the same place.

The ACP is cosidered add , commit and push.

The local Git repository has three components:

* Working Directory
* Index
* Head

First we prepare the file to share with cloud by using git add , then use git add . command to add all change in the same directory , after thaty we should using git commit -m " the message" to tell who do this change and what is the change.

Also I can use clone command to take the project that belongs to other developer and edit it on my device.
